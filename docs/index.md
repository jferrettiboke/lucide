# Introduction

Lucide is an open-source icon library for displaying icons and symbols in both digital and non-digital projects. It offers a collection of 1000+ vector (SVG) files. To simplify the integration of these icons into projects, Lucide provides several official packages.

Lucide encompasses icons with various variants and states, allowing designers and developers to select the most suitable icon for their needs. If a desired icon is not available, users are encouraged to submit a design request. The Lucide community contributors are dedicated to creating new icons and fulfilling such requests.

By expanding the range of available icons, Lucide provides users with a broader selection for their projects. Furthermore, as new applications with specific features emerge, Lucide aims to be a comprehensive icon set to meet diverse project requirements.

When designing new icons, the community adheres to a strict set of design rules to ensure consistency and legibility on all sizes. While creativity is encouraged, easily recognizable design is of greater importance to maintain our [design conventions](https://lucide.dev/docs/icon-design-guide).

In addition to design considerations, code optimization plays a vital role. Assets like icons in web projects can significantly impact bandwidth usage. In response, Lucide takes responsibility for minimizing asset size. This is achieved through SVG compression and employing a specific code architecture with tree-shaking capabilities. With tree-shaking, only the icons utilized in a project are shipped, effectively reducing the overall software distribution size.
